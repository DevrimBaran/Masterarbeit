	abstract = {A wait-free implementation of a concurrent data object is one that guarantees that any process can complete any operation in a finite number of steps, regardless of the execution speeds of the other processes. The problem of constructing a wait-free implementation of one data object from another lies at the heart of much recent work in concurrent algorithms, concurrent data structures, and multiprocessor architectures. First, we introduce a simple and general technique, based on reduction to a concensus protocol, for proving statements of the form, “there is no wait-free implementation of X by Y.” We derive a hierarchy of objects such that no object at one level has a wait-free implementation in terms of objects at lower levels. In particular, we show that atomic read/write registers, which have been the focus of much recent attention, are at the bottom of the hierarchy: thay cannot be used to construct wait-free implementations of many simple and familiar data types. Moreover, classical synchronization primitives such astest&set and fetch&add, while more powerful than read and write, are also computationally weak, as are the standard message-passing primitives. Second, nevertheless, we show that there do exist simple universal objects from which one can construct a wait-free implementation of any sequential object.},

	abstract = {Lock-freedom is a progress guarantee that ensures overall program progress. Wait-freedom is a stronger progress guarantee that ensures the progress of each thread in the program. While many practical lock-free algorithms exist, wait-free algorithms are typically inefficient and hardly used in practice. In this paper, we propose a methodology called fast-path-slow-path for creating efficient wait-free algorithms. The idea is to execute the efficient lock-free version most of the time and revert to the wait-free version only when things go wrong. The generality and effectiveness of this methodology is demonstrated by two examples. In this paper, we apply this idea to a recent construction of a wait-free queue, bringing the wait-free implementation to perform in practice as efficient as the lock-free implementation. In another work, the fast-path-slow-path methodology has been used for (dramatically) improving the performance of a wait-free linked-list.},

	abstract = {Lock-free data structures guarantee overall system progress, whereas wait-free data structures guarantee the progress of each and every thread, providing the desirable non-starvation guarantee for concurrent data structures. While practical lock-free implementations are known for various data structures, wait-free data structure designs are rare. Wait-free implementations have been notoriously hard to design and often inefficient. In this work we present a transformation of lock-free algorithms to wait-free ones allowing even a non-expert to transform a lock-free data-structure into a practical wait-free one. The transformation requires that the lock-free data structure is given in a normalized form defined in this work. Using the new method, we have designed and implemented wait-free linked-list, skiplist, and tree and we measured their performance. It turns out that for all these data structures the wait-free implementations are only a few percent slower than their lock-free counterparts, while still guaranteeing non-starvation.},

This paper provides a detailed analysis of how Rust effectively addresses memory safety concerns. The paper first introduces the concepts of ownership, reference and lifetime in Rust, highlighting how they contribute to ensuring memory safety. It then delves into an examination of common memory safety issues and how they manifest in popular programming languages. Rust’s solutions to these issues are compared to those of other languages, emphasizing the benefits of using Rust for enhanced memory safety. In conclusion, this paper offers a comprehensive exploration of prevalent memory safety issues in programming and demonstrates how Rust effectively addresses them. With its encompassing mechanisms and strict rules, Rust proves to be a reliable choice for developers aiming to achieve enhanced memory safety in their programming endeavors.},

	abstract = {The rapid progress of multi-/many-core architectures has caused data-intensive parallel applications not yet be fully suited for getting the maximum performance. The advent of parallel programming frameworks offering structured patterns has alleviated developers' burden adapting such applications to parallel platforms. For example, the use of synchronization mechanisms in multithreaded applications is essential on shared-cache multi-core architectures. However, ensuring an appropriate use of their interfaces can be challenging, since different memory models plus instruction reordering at compiler/processor levels may influence the occurrence of data races. The benefits of race detectors are formidable in this sense, nevertheless if lock-free data structures with no high-level atomics are used, they may emit false positives. In this paper, we extend the ThreadSanitizer race detection tool in order to support semantics of the general Single-Producer/Single-Consumer (SPSC) lock-free parallel queue and to detect benign data races where it was correctly used. To perform our analysis, we leverage the FastFlow SPSC bounded lock-free queue implementation to test our extensions over a set of μ-benchmarks and real applications on a dual-socket Intel Xeon CPU E5-2695 platform. We demonstrate that this approach can reduce, on average, 30\% the number of data race warning messages.},
