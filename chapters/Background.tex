\chapter{Background}

To establish a clear foundation for the concepts and definitions introduced throughout this thesis, we provide a fundamental overview of the key topics relevant to this research. This includes an introduction to real-time systems, \acf{IPC}, and synchronization techniques, with a particular focus on wait-free and lock-free synchronization. Additionally, we examine the Rust programming language, as it serves as the primary development environment for this study. Furthermore, we explore existing synchronization methods in real-time systems to contextualize the motivation and contributions of this work.
