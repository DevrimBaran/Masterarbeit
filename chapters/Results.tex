\chapter{Benchmarking and Results}\label{ch:results}
To finish the objective of this thesis at last a setting needs to be build were these algorithms are used for \ac{IPC} over shared memory. This setting was also used to benchmark the performance of these algorithms. In the \cite{githubMA} a folder benches can be found which All these algorithms that were implemented also need to be benchmarked in a setting simulating \ac{IPC} over shared memory. To do that \texttt(criterion) was used
