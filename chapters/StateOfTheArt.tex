\chapter{State of the Art}

To understand what is meant by all the terms and definition in the previous introduction and generally in this thesis, we will first look at how current real-time systems are built and how they work. This will include multiple topics such as real-time systems, inter-process communication, synchronization, wait-free synchronization and lock-free synchronization. We will also look at the Rust programming language since that is the language that is in the scope of this thesis.
